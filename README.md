# App Gen Base (Private)
**Repository:** spynejs-starter-app  

A production-ready template generated by the **SpyneJS App Builder**.  
This scaffold is optimized for building responsive, enterprise-grade SpyneJS applications using the **VBL (View–Behavior–Logic)** architecture.

---

## ✨ Features

### 🔧 Webpack Dev/Prod Environments
- **`npm start`** → Hot reload development server  
- **`npm run build`** → Optimized production build

### 🧩 SpyneJS “VBL” Structure
- **View** → `.ViewStream` components for rendering  
- **Behavior** → Channels for events/data flow  
- **Logic** → Traits for shared and custom logic  
- Clean separation of concerns for scalability and AI-aligned generation

### 🎨 SCSS Integration
- Full SCSS/SASS support out of the box
- Includes **Spyne Grid System** for mobile-first, utility-driven layouts

### 🧪 Unit Testing
- Preconfigured with **Web-Test-Runner** using Mocha & Chai

### 📏 Linting / Formatting
- ESLint rules + recommended formatting for consistent code style

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

Clone your generated app or run via **`spyne-cli`**:

```bash
git clone <your-generated-repo>
cd <project-folder>
npm install
npm start
```

## 📐 Spyne Grid System (Mobile-First)

This project includes a lightweight, mobile-first grid system for rapid layout that avoids the complexity of large, utility-heavy frameworks.

### Available Utilities

| Utility              | Description |
|----------------------|-------------|
| `.grid-N`            | Grid container with N equal columns (2, 3, 4, 6, 12) |
| `.col-N`             | Span N columns (1–12) — **mobile-first** |
| `md:col-N`           | Span N columns at ≥ breakpoint |
| `.row-N`             | Span N rows (1–12) |
| `md:row-N`           | Span N rows at ≥ breakpoint |
| `.order-N`           | Change item order (0–12) — works in flex/grid |
| `md:order-N`         | Order override at ≥ breakpoint |
| `.gap-N`             | Set grid gap using spacing scale from `variables.scss` |

### Breakpoints
| Prefix | Min-width |
|--------|-----------|
| `sm:`  | 640px     |
| `md:`  | 768px     |
| `lg:`  | 1024px    |
| `xl:`  | 1280px    |

### Example: Hero Layout

**Side-by-side on desktop, stacked reverse on mobile:**
```html
<section class="page-header grid-12 gap-0">
  <div class="callout col-12 md:col-4 order-2 md:order-1">
    <h1>Don’t Miss Out</h1>
    <p>Take advantage of our exclusive resources and offers!</p>
  </div>
  <figure class="bg-image col-12 md:col-8 order-1 md:order-2">
    <img src="hero.jpg" alt="">
  </figure>
</section>
```

- **Mobile (<768px)** → both span 12 cols, image above callout  
- **Desktop (≥768px)** → callout = 4 cols left, image = 8 cols right

## 🎨 Styling & Design System

This project comes with a SCSS-based **SpyneJS Design System** designed for enterprise-grade maintainability and rapid iteration.

- **Token-Driven**: Colors, typography, and spacing are defined in a central variables file and exposed as both SCSS variables and CSS custom properties.
- **Layout Utilities**: Includes a lightweight grid system and responsive utility classes for columns, rows, ordering, and gaps.
- **Broad Layout Adjustments**: Apply sweeping layout changes by updating a few key tokens or grid settings—no need to refactor every component.

More detailed documentation on the design system and theming options will be provided in a dedicated section soon.
